          Dedan Kimathi Waciuri, was born on the 31<sup>st</sup>of October in
          the year 1920. Dedan Kimathi was the senior military and spiritual
          leader of the Mau Mau uprising, and since he was widely regarded as a
          revolutionary leader, he lead the armed military struggle against the
          British colonial regime in Kenya in the 1950's until his capture in
          1956 and execution, 0n the 18<sup>th</sup> of February 1957.

        <p class="article-paragraphs">
          Kenyan nationalists view him as the heroic figurehead of the Kenyan
          freedom struggle against the British colonial rule, while the british
          government saw him as a terrorist. Despite having fought for the
          nation's liberation, it was during the Mwai Kibaki regime that Kimathi
          and his fellow Mau Mau companions were officially recognized as heroes
          in the struggle for Kenyan Independence. This recognition culminated
          to the unveiling of a Kimathi statue in 2007.

        <p class="article-paragraphs" id="last-paragraph">
          The Kibaki government erected a 2.1 metre bronze statue titled Freedom
          Fighter Dedan Kimathi on a graphite plinth, in central Nairobi. The
          statue is at the junction of Kimathi Street and Mama Ngina Street.
          Kimathi, clad in military regalia, holds a rifle in the right hand and
          a dagger in the left, the last weapons he held in his struggle.
